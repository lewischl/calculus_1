BEGIN_TEXT
In this problem, we're requiring that both points for the secant lines are points on the graph of a function \(y = y(x)\).  

$PAR $HR $PAR

The point \( P = (x_0, y_0) = ( $x0 , $y0 ) \) lies on the curve \( y = $a1 / x \), corresponding to \(x_0 = $x0\).   $BR
Let \( Q \) be the point \( (x_1, \, $a1 / x_1 ) .\) $BR$BR

$BBOLD a.) $BR $EBOLD Find the slope of the secant line \( PQ \) for the following values of \( x_1 \). $BR$BR

If \( x_1= $x1 \), the slope of \( PQ \) is: \{ans_rule(25) \} $BR


If \( x_1= $x01 \), the slope of \( PQ \) is: \{ans_rule(25)\} $BR


If \( x_1= $x9 \), the slope of \( PQ \) is: \{ans_rule(25)\} $BR


If \( x_1= $x99 \), the slope of \( PQ \) is: \{ans_rule(25) \} $BR$BR


$BBOLD b.) $BR $EBOLD Based on the above results, average the slopes from the two closest points we used, to estimate the slope of the tangent
line to the curve at \( P($x0 , $y0 ) \). 

$PAR

Your answer: \{ans_rule(25) \}

(Use lots of decimal places!!!)

$PAR

Here's a diagram you'll hopefully find helpful, for a particular function \(y = y(x) = 6/x\).  The number in your numerator is probably different.

When guessing the instantaneous, use the two points nearest it.  Average them.
