[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
A squeeze theorem problem where we don't give you the bounding functions.  This problem aims to help you find your own bounding functions.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

Keep in mind that we need to be able to give complete justification for our answers.

---

In this problem, our function of interest is [`f(x) = [$f]`], and we're interested in the limit at [`x = 0`].  But the function is an indeterminate form [`0 \cdot ?`] there!!!  What to do!

ðŸ’¡ The function involves a wave --- [`\sin([$a] / x)`], which is bounded between inside [`[-1, 1]`].  So think of the leading [`x^2`] as the amplitude of the wave.  This leads to an easy pair of bounding functions to use for the squeeze theorem:

* [`\ell(x) = -x^2`]
* [`u(x) = x^2`]

These two functions squeeze [`f`] near [`x = 0`], so we can use the squeeze theorem to find the value of the limit there.

BEGIN_TEXT
Evaluate the limit.  If the limit does not exist enter DNE.

$ans = Compute(0);
ANS($ans->cmp());

BEGIN_SOLUTION
We know that \(-1 \leq \sin\left(\frac{$a}{x}\right) \leq 1\). It follows that: \(-x^2 \leq x \sin\left(\frac{$a}{x}\right) \leq x^2 \).
$BR Since \(\displaystyle \lim_{ x \rightarrow 0 } x = 0\), 
\(\displaystyle \lim_{ x \rightarrow 0 } x \sin\left(\frac{$a}{x}\right)\) must also equal 0 by the Squeeze Theorem.
