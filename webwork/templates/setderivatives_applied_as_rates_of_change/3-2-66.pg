BEGIN_TEXT
An automobile starts from rest and travels down a straight
section of road.  The distance \(s\) (in feet) of the car from the
starting position after \(t\) seconds is given by
\( s(t) = $s. \)
$PAR
(a) Find the instantaneous velocity (in feet per second) at \(t = $time1\) seconds.
$PAR
Instantaneous velocity at \(t = $time1\) is \{ans_rule(20) \} ft/s.
$PAR
(b) Find the instantaneous velocity in (feet per second) at \(t = $time2\) seconds.
$PAR
Instantaneous velocity at \(t = $time2\) is \{ans_rule(20) \} ft/s.
