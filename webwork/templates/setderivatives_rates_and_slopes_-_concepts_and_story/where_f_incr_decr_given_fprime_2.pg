[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*

The meaning of a function is only given by context.  By interpreting a given function either as [`f`] or [`f'`], we get different outcomes.

In this problem, we give you a derivative, but not the original function.  This is actually pretty common: sometimes it's easier to know how fast something is changing than how much of that thing you have; for example, flow of water into/out of a lake.

[@ closeDiv() @]*


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*

* a horizontal tangent line has slope 0, and tangent lines with slope 0 are horizontal
* [`f'`] is positive where [`f`] is increasing
* [`f'`] is negative where [`f`] is decreasing
* [`f'`] is the slope of [`f`]

These all are still true if we only have information about [`f'`], the slope function for [`f`].
[@ closeDiv() @]*

---
Here's a graph of the derivative [`f'`] of an unknown function.  Assume all the interesting behaviour is depicted.

>>[@ image(insertGraph($graph1), width => 500, height => 300) @]*<<


---

For what interval(s) is [`f(x)`] increasing?  If there are no such intervals, use "none".   Remember, I gave you [`f'`], not [`f`] in the graph above!

On the interval(s) [_____]{interval_cmp($interval_increasing, strings=>["none"])}, [`f`] is increasing. 


---

For what interval(s) is [`f(x)`] decreasing?  

On the interval(s) [_____]{interval_cmp($interval_decreasing, strings=>["none"])}, [`f`] is decreasing.


---

What is the leftmost [`x`] coordinate at which [`f`] has horizontal tangent line?  

At [`x = `] [_____]{$x_der_zero}.
