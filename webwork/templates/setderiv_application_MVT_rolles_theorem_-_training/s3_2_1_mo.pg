[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
The mean value theorem guarantees the average rate of change is attained, for differential phenomena -- at least once.  Sometimes the rate is attained more than once.  This problem offers guidance.

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
The Mean Value Theorem (MVT)

If a function [`f`] is both:

1. differentable inside an interval [`(a,b)`]
2. continuous on all of [`[a,b]`],

then there *must* exist a point [`x = c`] inside [`(a,b)`] such that:

[``` \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c) ```]

BEGIN_TEXT

\{ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) \}
We want to find the point(s) at which the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the average rate of change.  $PAR
1. Find the derivative (instantanous rate of change) and set it equal to the average rate you computed above.  $BR
2. Solve.

We only 100% *know* this will succeed because of the MVT.
\{ closeDiv() \} 

$PAR

Consider the function \( f(x) = $fun\) on the interval \( [ -$c1 , $c1 ] \). $PAR
ðŸŽ¯ Find the average or mean slope of the function on this interval. $BR
\(\textnormal{average slope} = \) \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR$BR

Note that \(f\) is differentiable and continuous on \( [ -$c1 , $c1 ] \).  Thus, by the Mean Value Theorem, we know there must exist at least one \( c \) in the open interval
\( ( -$c1 , $c1 ) \) such that \( f'( c) \) is equal to this mean slope.  

$PAR
ðŸŽ¯ Find such values \(c\), and use a comma-separated list. 


$PAR

The AROC is attained at \(c = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}  $SPACE
