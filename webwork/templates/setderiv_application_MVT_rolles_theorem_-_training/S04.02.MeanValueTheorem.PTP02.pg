Training on Rolle's theorem
[@ closeDiv() @]*

Rolle's Theorem is a common-sense theorem: If a thing starts and stops at the same point, and moves differentiably, then it must reverse course at some point.

Rolle's Theorem is a "special case" of the Mean Value Theorem -- the average rate of change is zero if a thing starts and stops at the same point.


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
Rolle's Theorem

If a function [`f`] has the following three properties:

1. differentable inside an interval [`(a,b)`]
2. continuous on all of [`[a,b]`],
3. [`f(a) = f(b)`]

then...

there *must* exist a point [`x = c`] inside [`(a,b)`] at which the derivative is [`0`]:

[``` f'(c) = 0```]
[@ closeDiv() @]*

🧠 Rolle's Theorem is an "existential" statement: we *know* [`c`] exists, but we didn't get a recipe to compute it.

In this problem you will use Rolle's theorem conclude, without a graph evaluation, that the function \[ f(x) = $displayfunction \] 
cannot possibly have two or more real roots.  $PAR

Equivalently, we'll prove it's impossible for the graph of \( y = f(x) \) to cross the \(x\)-axis two or more times). $BR$BR

🗺️ Plan of attack: $PAR


We're engaging in the mathematical activity called "proof".  We're going to find a contradiction ⚡️ by assuming that the function $BBOLD does $EBOLD have two or more roots.  🎯 Fill in the pieces to complete the narrative argument.

$PAR $BR

1. Suppose that \( f(x) \) has at least two real roots.  (This is the "assume" step -- we're disproving it at the end)
$PAR

2. We can arbitrarily choose two of these roots, and call the smaller one \( a \) and the 
larger one \( b \).  
$PAR

3. We show \(f\) satisfies the requirements for Rolle's theorem on the interval \( [a,b] \).  We can do this because the function values at \(a\) and \(b\) are \{ $pops1->menu() \}.
$PAR
Thus, there exists at least one number 
\( c \) in the interval \( (a,b) \) so that \( f'(c) = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}.

$PAR

4. Arrive at a contradiction ⚡️: a statement you know to be true, must also be false.  Here's the thing!  The values of the derivative \( f'(x) = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} are always 
\{pop_up_list(['?','changing','negative','zero','positive','undefined']) \} because \{ $pops2->menu() \},
and therefore it is \{pop_up_list(['?','plausible','unlikely','possible','impossible']) \}
for \( f(x) \) to have two or more real roots.
