BEGIN_TEXT

The point of this problem is that vertical asymptotes correspond with places where the denominator is 0 but the numerator isn't.  

$PAR

\{
ColumnTable(
"Match the graphs with the corresponding formulas.".
$ml->print_q() 
, # comma!
$BCENTER.
$ml->print_a().
$BR.
"(Click on a graph to enlarge it)".
$ECENTER
, # comma!

)
\}

$PAR

Note that the "vertical lines" are vertical asymptotes, and the plotting software is connecting dots across discontinuities.  One has to use special techniques to avoid this phenomenon, and the person who wrote this problem didn't.

The formulas match as follows: 
1 matches graph $a[0], $BR
2 matches graph $a[1], $BR
3 matches graph $a[2], $BR
4 matches graph $a[3], $BR
5 matches graph $a[4], and $BR
