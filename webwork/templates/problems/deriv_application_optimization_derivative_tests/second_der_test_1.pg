BEGIN_PGML
The second derivative test is a way to classify critical points of a function.  The below graph depicts [`f''(x)`], the *second* derivative of a function [`f`].

>>[@ image(insertGraph($graph1), width => 500, height => 500) @]*<<



---

For each given critical point of [`f`] (that is, I've computed the roots of [`f'`] for you -- we have neither [`f`] nor [`f'`] at-hand in this problem), use the second derivative test to determine whether [`f`] has a local min, a local max, or indicate if the classification test fails.

* If [`x = [$c[0]]`] were a critical point, then [`f`] would have a [_]{$classification0} there.

* If [`x = [$c[1]]`] were a critical point, then [`f`] would have a [_]{$classification1} there.

* If [`x = [$c[2]]`] were a critical point, then [`f`] would have a [_]{$classification2} there.

* If [`x = [$c[3]]`] were a critical point, then [`f`] would have a [_]{$classification3} there.
