BEGIN_TEXT
Let \( f(x) = \dfrac{$a x^2}{$b-$c x}\), and compute the following derivatives:
$PAR
\( f'(x) \) = \{ans_rule(50) \}$BR
\( f''( x ) \) = \{ans_rule(50) \}

$PAR
\{ theresahint \}
END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
The first derivative, \(f'\), has a *something squared*.  So when we want to compute \(f''\), we'll have to deal with that, and it's going to be difficult.  I suggest that you expand and collect both the numerator and denominator of \(f'\), before computing \(f''\).
