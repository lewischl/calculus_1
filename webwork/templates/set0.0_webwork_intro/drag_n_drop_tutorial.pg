BEGIN_TEXT

This problem gives you training on drag-and-drop style problems.  You're given blocks in a column on the left, and you move some or all of the blocks to the right column, and put them in the correct order.  

Put \{ $CorrectProof->numNeeded \} of the following so that they look like: 

$PAR  $BCENTER $BITALIC

A, B, C, D, E

$EITALIC $ECENTER

with A at the top and E at the bottom.

$PAR



\{ $CorrectProof->Print \}

END_TEXT

ANS($CorrectProof->cmp);
