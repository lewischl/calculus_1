BEGIN_PGML

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Training summation notation:
* re-indexing / shifting
[@ closeDiv() @]*

ðŸ§  There are an infinite number of ways to write the same sum.  Check it out. 

[@ $tab @]*

The last row is what happens in general, which I'll describe in words:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*Shifting indexes in a sum*

* Shift indexes down by [`d`], add [`d`] inside the formula in the sum
* Shift indexes up by [`d`], subtract [`d`] inside the formula in the sum
[@ closeDiv() @]*
