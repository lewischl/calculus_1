BEGIN_PGML

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Functions of the form in this problem often give students trouble, so training on this specific form.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

Recall the "natural log rule", in box notation:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
[```
(\ln \Box)' = \frac{\Box'}{\Box}
```]
[@ closeDiv() @]*

ℹ️ If you spy a rational function where the numerator is close to the derivative of the denominator, it may be the result of differentiating a natural log.


---

Evaluate the indefinite integrals.  To reinforce the importance of the constant of integration, I continue to ask you to write it in answers.

This first one is polynomials to help you see the pattern: $PAR
\( \displaystyle \int \frac{$u_prime}{$u} \, dx  = \)
\{ans_rule( 30) \} 
$PAR $BR

$a = random(2,6,1);
$b = random(2,8,1);
$c = $a * $b;
$coeff = 1 / $b;
$ans = "$coeff * ln(abs(sin(x) + $a))";

BEGIN_TEXT
This second one I offer because it's potentially confusing.  The derivative of \(\sin\) is \(\cos\), and derivative of \(\cos\) is \(-\sin\).  Which to choose for \(u\)?  $BR🧠 Choose \(u\) as the denominator, because we won't get a constant in a derivative, without a linear to start. $PAR
\( \displaystyle \int \frac{\cos x}{$b \sin x + $c} \, dx  = \)
\{ans_rule( 30) \} 
$PAR $BR
