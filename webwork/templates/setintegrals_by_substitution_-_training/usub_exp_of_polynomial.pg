$a = random(3,9,1);

$coeff = 1 / $a;
$funct = "$coeff * e^(x^$a)";

BEGIN_TEXT
Evaluate the indefinite integral.
$BR \[ \int x^$power e^{x^$a} dx \]
$BR 
\(\displaystyle \int x^$power e^{x^$a} \, dx = \) \{ans_rule( 40) \} \(+C\)



END_TEXT


ANS(fun_cmp($funct, limits=>[0.75,1.25], mode=>"antider"));

BEGIN_HINT
We want \(u\) to be the thing *inside*.  Maybe rewriting the integral as \(\displaystyle \int x^$power \exp(x^$a) \, dx\) helps reveal which is the inside?
