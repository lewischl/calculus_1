# Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Someone has leaned a ladder precariously against a wall, and it's sliding away, as in Figures 5 and 6 of your book, on page 200.  The dimensions are different, though!
$BR$BR

The length of the ladder is $ladder meters, and the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at an alarming $dh_dt meters per second.

$BR$BR

Calculate the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall when the top of the ladder is $h meters from the floor.


$BR$BR
The bottom of the ladder is sliding away at \{ans_rule(40) \} meters per second.

# Answers

$showPartialCorrectAnswers = 1;

$ans= $h*$dh_dt / sqrt($ladder**2 - $h**2);

ANS(Real($ans)->cmp);


BEGIN_HINT

This is a sliding ladder problem, similar to Example 3, page 200 in Rogawski 4th Edition.
