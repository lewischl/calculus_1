[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
There are four common non-basic trig functions.  This problem offers training on their derivatives.
[@ closeDiv() @]*



[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
The trig function derivatives:

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \sin x = \cos x`]

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \cos x = -\sin x \hspace{1cm}`]   --- 👀 fn starts with letter [`c`], get a [`-`].

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \tan x = \sec^2 x`]

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \sec x = \sec x \tan x`]

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \csc x = -\csc x \cot x \hspace{1cm}`]   ---  👀 fn starts with letter [`c`], get a [`-`].

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \cot x = -\csc^2 x \hspace{1cm}`]   ---  👀 fn starts with letter [`c`], get a [`-`].


⚠️ This ignores what happens if a function is inside the trig.  We must use the chain rule to differentiate functions-inside-of-functions.
