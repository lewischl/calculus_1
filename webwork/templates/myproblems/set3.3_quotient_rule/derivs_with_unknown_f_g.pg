BEGIN_TEXT
The various rules for derivatives tell us how to compute derivatives of various combinations of functions.  The basic arithmetic operations are +,-,*, and /.  The sum, difference, product, and quotient rules give us recipes for how to concoct the derivatives of functions thusly built.

$BR$BR

The rules work when you have formulas for \(f\) and \(g\).  They also work when you don't, but you only have the values for \(f\), \(g\), \(f^\prime\), and \(g^\prime\) at a point of interest \(x=a=$a\).  This problem has you evaluate derivatives in this case.


$BR$BR

Given that
$BR$BR
\(f($a) =  $f\)$BR
\(f'($a)=$df \)$BR
\(g($a) =  $g\)$BR
\(g'($a)=$dg \),
$BR$BR
calculate the following:
$BR$BR
\((f+g)'($a) = \) \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
\((f-g)'($a) = \) \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
\((f\cdot g)'($a) = \) \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
\((f/g)'($a) = \) \{ans_rule(10) \}
