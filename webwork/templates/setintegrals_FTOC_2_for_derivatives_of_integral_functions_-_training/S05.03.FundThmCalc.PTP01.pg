# Create the graph =======================================

# function and then uses too few sample points).
# For example, compare the two methods when $select = 2;
# Create function to be plotted in graph

#$f->color('blue');
#$f->domain(0,8);
#$f->weight(2);
#foreach $i (0..8) { $graph->stamps(closed_circle($i,@y_values[$i], 'blue') ); } 

# Better quality graph (connects only the data points listed by lines)
# the construct $image->im(); allows us to access commands in GD.pm 
# directly that are not available to us through WebWork macros

BEGIN_PGML
Integral functions are functions defined by an integral where the bounds depend on a variable.  The general form  of an integral functions is 

[```
F(x) = \int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(t)\, dt
```]

We give these a special name when:
* the lower bound is fixed
* the upper bound is simply [`x`]

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
An "Area function" is defined by:

[```
A(x) = \int_{a}^{x} f(t)\, dt
```]

[`A`] measures the signed area bounded by [`f`], from [`a`] to [`x`].
[@ closeDiv() @]*

ℹ️ To compute the value of an area function at a point, integrate.

(A) The net area under the function \( y = f(t) \) can be calculated by subdividing the region between the \(t\)-axis and the function into rectangles, triangles, and trapezoids whose area can be easily calculated.

$PAR 

(B) The function \(A(x)\) is increasing when \(f(t)\) is above the \(t\) axis, decreasing when \(f(t)\) is below the \(t\) axis, and is neither increasing nor decreasing when \(f(t)\) is on the \(t\) axis.

$PAR

(C) To find the maximum and minimum values of the function \(A(x)\), all you need to do is to find the largest and smallest values from your answer to part (A).
