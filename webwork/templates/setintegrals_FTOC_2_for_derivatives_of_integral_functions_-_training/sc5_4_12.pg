Training on 
* "integral functions": functions defined by the integral of a known function
* derivatives of basic integral functions using the FTOC2
[@ closeDiv() @]*

If you're into videos, here's one on Area Functions by Prof. Amethyst:

[@ youtube("JxZytdIEe18") @]*


---

We've studied definite integrals: they compute signed areas bounded by curves, and they represent net change.  We can use definite integrals to define a new class of functions!

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*Definition of integral function*

An "integral function" is a function defined by an integral, with the variable being in one of the bounds of integration.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

For example, this [`F`] is an integral function:

* [`F(x) = \int_{[$lower_bound]}^x [$f_of_t] \, dt `]

The bounds of the integral depend on the variable of [`F`].  In order to evaluate [`F`], we have to evaluate an integral:

* [`F(\pi) = \int_{[$lower_bound]}^{\pi} [$f_of_t] \, dt `]
* [`F(0) = \int_{[$lower_bound]}^{0} [$f_of_t] \, dt `]

Here's a Desmos graph of the integral function [`F`]:

[@  $desmos_graph @]*

ðŸŽ¯ Play with the slider for [`x`] and observe how the area changes.

In the interval [`x \in [-1,2]`], at what point is the area changing the fastest? At [`x = `] [_]{Real(2)}

---

##### Rates of area accumulation

We like differetiating functions, to find their slopes, to find out how fast they're changing.  Integral functions are these new types of functions.  

In our quest to "differentiate all the things", we now have an important question:

>>*what's the derivative of an integral function?*<<

Observe by playing with the above Desmos graph:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
The rate of area accumulation is exactly the height of the function bounding the area
[@ closeDiv() @]*

* If the integrand has height [`0`], then no area is accumulated.
* If the integrand is positive, positive area is accumulated.
* If the integrand is negative, negative area is accumulated.

ðŸ§  It sounds a lot like the integrand of an integral function is the rate at which area is accumulated.  And it is ðŸŽ‰

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2* (FTOC2)

[```
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_a^x f(t) \, dt \right)= f(x)
```]

Simply: the derivative of the integral, is the integrand.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

I like to think of it this way:

* We integrate rates of change.  
* When we integrate, we compute a net change.  

The rate at which change accumulates, is the rate of change.  

---

We just discovered the derivative of the integral function we've been working with:

[``F(x) = \int_{[$lower_bound]}^x [$f_of_t] \, dt ``], and so so it must be

[``\frac{d}{dx} F(x) = [$f_of_x]``] by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2.
