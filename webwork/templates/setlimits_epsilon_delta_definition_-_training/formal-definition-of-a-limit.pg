BEGIN_PGML
For all [` \epsilon > 0 `], there exists a [` \delta > 0 `] so that [` | [$f] - [$L] | < \epsilon `] when [` | x - [$a] | < \delta `].

Using the information above above, fill in the blanks below based on the formal definition of a limit and limit notation.

[`` \lim_{x \to a} ``] [_______]{"$f"} = [___]{$L}

[` a = `] [___]{$a}
