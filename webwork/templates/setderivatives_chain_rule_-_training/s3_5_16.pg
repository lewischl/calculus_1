BEGIN_PGML

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Derivatives of the non-basic trig functions have more complicated structure than they start with.  This problem offers training on correctly computing them.
[@ closeDiv() @]*


The trig function derivatives:

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \sin x = \cos x`]

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \cos x = -\sin x \hspace{1cm}`]   --- 👀 fn starts with letter [`c`], get a [`-`].

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \tan x = \sec^2 x`]

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \sec x = \sec x \tan x`]

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \csc x = -\csc x \cot x \hspace{1cm}`]   ---  👀 fn starts with letter [`c`], get a [`-`].

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \cot x = -\csc^2 x \hspace{1cm}`]   ---  👀 fn starts with letter [`c`], get a [`-`].


⚠️ These phrasings neglect what happens when the inside is more complicated than just [`x`] (or whatever the variable is named).


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
The trig function derivatives with the chain rule:

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \sin \Box = \cos (\Box)   \, \Box'`]

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \cos \Box = -\sin (\Box)  \,  \Box'`]  

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \tan \Box = \sec^2 (\Box)   \, \Box'`]

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \sec \Box = \sec (\Box) \tan (\Box)  \,  \Box'`]

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \csc \Box = -\csc (\Box) \cot (\Box)   \, \Box'`]   

* [`\frac{d}{dx} \cot \Box = -\csc^2 (\Box)  \,  \Box'`]   

🧠 Whatever is in [`\Box`] goes in all instances of [`\Box`].  Just "chain out" the derivative of the inside!

Here's some advice for the first part.$PAR

Tangent's derivative has only once piece, so the argument \(\Box = (x^$a1+x) \) goes inside the resulting \(\sec^2 \Box\), and then the derivative \(\Box' = ($a1 x^{$a1-1} + 1)\) is multiplied on the outside.$PAR
