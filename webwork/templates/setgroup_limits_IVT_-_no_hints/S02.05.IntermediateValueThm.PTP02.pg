BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Let \( f(x) = x^3-3x +$b \). The function \(f\) is continuous on the closed 
interval \([ 0,1]\). We have
\[ f(0)= $b > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f(1) = $b2 < 0  \]
Since \(f(1)<0<f(0) \), the Intermediate Value Theorem says that there is a number \(c\) in the interval 
\( (0,1)\) such that \(f(c) = 0 \). Thus the equation \( x^3-3x +$b =0\) does have a root
in the interval \( (0,1)  \).
END_SOLUTION

if ($a <0) {$sign = '<'; $st='f(1)<f(0)<0'}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Let \( f(x) = x^3-3x +$b \). The function \(f\) is continuous on the closed 
interval \([ 0,1]\). We have
\[ f(0)= $b $sign 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f(1) = $b2 $sign 0  \]
Since \($st \), the Intermediate Value Theorem does not imply  that  there is a number \(c\) in the interval \( (0,1)\) such that \(f(c) = 0 \), that is,  the theorem does not imply that the equation \( x^3-3x +$b =0\)  has a root
in the interval \( (0,1)  \).
