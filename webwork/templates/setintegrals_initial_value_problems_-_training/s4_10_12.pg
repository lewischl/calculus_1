[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Differential equations and initial value problems feel a bit more natural if they use [`t`] as the variable,  since as humans we often experience change over time.  

This problem offers training on an IVP with a slightly unfamiliar function
[@ closeDiv() @]*


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*Steps to solve an initial value problem*

1. Write down the differential equation, [`\frac{dF}{dt} = f(t)`]
2. Integrate.
    1. Move the [`dt`] to the other side to get [`dF = f(t) \, dt`]
    2. Integrate both sides.  You'll have [`F = \int f(t) \, dt`]
    3. Integrate [`f(t)`], and include the constant of integration [`C`].  Now you have [`F_\textnormal{general}`].
3. Use the given point on the curve [`F`] to find the value of [`C`]
    1. Substitute [`x=a`] into [`F_\textnormal{general}`], and set equal to [`F(a)`].
    2. Solve
4. Replace [`C`] with its now-known value to obtain [`F`]

Let [` f(t) =  [$f]  `].
Find an antiderivative, [`F(t)`], of [`f(t)`] such that [` F([$a]) = [$Fofa] `].  
[@ closeDiv() @]*

🎯 First, find the general solution, with yet-unknown constant of integration, by integrating the given [`f(t)`].

[`F_\textnormal{general} = `] [_]{$F_general}

🎯 Plug in to [`F_\textnormal{general}`] to find the value of [`C`]

[`C = `] [_]{$C}

🎯 Put together.  The particular function [`F`] that satisfies this IVP is 

[`F(t)=`] [_]{$F_particular}

#Recall that for a term of the form \( Ax^n \) the antiderivative is
#just the term whose derivative is \( Ax^n \).  That is, 
#\(\frac{A}{n+1}x^{n+1} + C \) where \( C \) is an unknown constant.  Also,
#recall that the antiderivative of the \( \sec^2 \) function is the \( \tan \)
# function.  Applying these rules term-by-term to our function, we get:
#$BR$BR
#
#\[F(t) = $a1\tan{t} - \frac{$b1}{\{$n1+1\}}t^{\{$n1+1\}} + C\]
#\[\quad = $a1\tan{t} - \{$b1/($n1+1)\}t^{\{$n1+1\}} + C \]
#
#$BR$BR
#
#Where \( C \) is an artibrary constant.  We are further told that \( F(0) =
#0 \) so plugging this into the above general antiderivative, we get:
#$BR$BR
#
#\[ F(0) = $a1\tan{0} - \{$b1/($n1+1)\}(0)^{\{$n1+1\}} + C = 0 \]
# 
#$BR$BR
#
#So that the specific antiderivative is:
#\[
#  F(t) = $a1\tan{t} - \{$b1/($n1+1)\}t^{\{$n1+1\}}
#\]
