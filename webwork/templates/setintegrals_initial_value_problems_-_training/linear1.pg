[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This problem trains on "Initial Value Problems" (IVP's):
[@ closeDiv() @]*

In Calculus we study change.  When we integrate in applied scenarios (mathematical modeling), the function we're antidifferentiating represents a rate of change.  The antiderivative of a rate of change is an accumulant of change.  


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
Since [`\frac{d}{dx} C = 0`] for all constants, we can never know the values of constants in an antiderivative without extra knowledge.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

The world of *Initial Value Problems* gives you not only the rate of change, but also information about the initial state.  This can be used to find the value of [`C`], the constant of integration.  

This problem will guide you through the notation and general process for solving an initial value problem.

---

An initial value problem will include two ingredients:
1. A "differential equation", like [`\frac{dF}{dx} = f(x)`], and you'll have the formula for [`f`].
2. A point on the solution curve [`(a, F(a))`].
    * This might look like [`F(2) = 5`], to say that the point [`(2,5)`] is on the graph of [`y = F(x)`].

The solution pattern is about like these steps:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*Steps to solve an initial value problem*

1. Write down the differential equation, [`\frac{dF}{dx} = f(x)`]
2. Integrate.
    1. Move the [`dx`] to the other side to get [`dF = f(x) \, dx`]
    2. Integrate both sides.  You'll have [`F = \int f(x) \, dx`]
    3. Integrate [`f(x)`], and include the constant of integration [`C`].  
    The result to this point: [`F(x) = \textnormal{a function} + C`].
3. Use the given point on the curve [`F`] to find the value of [`C`]
    1. Substitute [`x=a`] into [`F`], and set equal to [`F(a)`].
    2. Solve

I'll guide you through all the steps on this problem.  Look for 🎯 where I ask you to do something in the narrative.

We start with the problem pose:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) @]*
Find the function [`F`] such that
[```
\frac{dF}{dx} = [$f]
```]
and
[``F([$a]) = [$Fofa]``]
[@ closeDiv() @]*

Our goal: find [`F`].  We have to integrate and then substitute-and-solve to find it.

##### 1. Write down the differential equation

On your paper,  🎯 write down the given differential equation, [`\frac{dF}{dx} = [$f]`].

##### 2. Integrate

Multiply both sides by [`dx`].  You should have [`dF = ([$f]) \, dx`]

Integate both sides.  Get [`F = \int ([$f]) \, dx`]

Now actually 🎯 do the integration of [`f`] and find the most general antiderivative.

[`F_\textnormal{gen}(x) = `] [_]{$F_general}

##### 3. Find the value of the constant of integration

We were given [`F([$a]) = [$Fofa]`].  This is a point on the curve.  

🎯 Plug [`x = [$a]`] into the general [`F_\textnormal{gen}(x)`], set it equal to [`F([$a]) = [$Fofa]`], and solve to find [`C`].

[`C = `] [_]{$C}


##### 4. Conclude

We've found the general solution and the constant of integration.  We just need to package them together, and find the specific function [`F`] going through the given point.  

🎯 Use the value of [`C`] with your general [`F_\textnormal{gen}`], to form the final [`F`].

[`F(x) = `] [_]{$F_particular}
