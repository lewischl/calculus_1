[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This problem makes IVP's really mean something.  Initial value problems are a way to tell the future, using the laws of motion:
* The first derivative is velocity
* The second derivative is acceleration

If we integrate acceleration twice, we should be able to predict position!

This problem also trains that the constants of integration for acceleration and velocity when using polynomials have a very special meaning.

BEGIN_TEXT


In this problem, we're given the acceleration function \(a(t)\), and we want the position function \(s(t)\).  As a first step, recognize that:$BR
â€¢ \(v(t) = \frac{ds}{dt}\)$BR
â€¢ \(a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt}\)$PAR

That is, to find position function \(s(t)\), we need to integrate twice, and at each step find the value of the constant of integration.

$PAR

To find \(s(t)\), I suggest a two-step process:$BR
1. Symbolically integrate \(a(t)\) once and find the constant of integration for \(v(t)\) using the initial condition for velocity.  $BR
2. Then, integrate \(v(t)\) and find the constant of integration for \(s(t)\) using initial condition for position.

\{ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) \}
A particle is moving with acceleration \( a(t) = $accel \) \({\rm m} / {\rm s}^2\)
$PAR
velocity at time \( t =$t0 \) is \( v($t0) = $v0 \) \({\rm m}/ {\rm s}\) $BR
position at time \( t =$t0 \) is \( s($t0) = $s0 \) \({\rm m} \) $BR
\{ closeDiv() \}
$PAR

First, ðŸŽ¯ find the general solution for the velocity function, with unknown constant of integration:
$BR
\( v_\textnormal{gen} = \) \{ans_rule(30) \} \({\rm m}/ {\rm s}\)
$PAR
Next, ðŸŽ¯ use the given known-velocity at a known-time to find the particular velocity function. $BR
\( v(t) = \) \{ans_rule(30) \} \({\rm m}/ {\rm s}\)


$BR$PAR

Now do the same steps, integrating and finding the constant of integration, to ðŸŽ¯ find the general and particular position functions. $BR
\( s_\textnormal{gen}(t) = \) \{ans_rule(30) \} \({\rm m} \) $BR
\( s(t) = \) \{ans_rule(30) \} \({\rm m} \)
$PAR

ðŸ”® We can predict the future now!  What will be the particle's position when \( t = $t_later\)? $BR
\(s($t_later) = \) \{ans_rule(30) \} \({\rm m} \)

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*

This problem shows that if 
* we know position and velocity at time [`t = 0`], and 
* the acceleration function is a polynomial, 

then the values of the constants of integration are simply the initial velocity and position.
