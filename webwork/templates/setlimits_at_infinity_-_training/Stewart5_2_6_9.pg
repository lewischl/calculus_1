Seeing growth in numbers is a powerful way to find patterns.  
[@ closeDiv() @]*

There are lots of good ways to compute function values quickly.  
* The "ans trick" in a TI is pretty hot ðŸ”¥
* The "trace trick" is good because it comes with a picture, but you have to have the x-value in the window for it to work
* You can also use the "y-vars trick".

$PAR

Guess the value of the limit by evaluating the function in the limit expression for 
\(  $x_vals \). 

$PAR 

Sketch a graph to support your conclusion.
