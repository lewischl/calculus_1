[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
Multiply by the conjugate to find a limit:

1. First, verify the method is a good candidate:    
    * Try to plug in point of interest.  Get an indeterminate form
    * Function is a rational function with square roots in it
2. Multiply by a special version of [`1`] -- the conjugate.
3. Distribute the part (top/bottom) with the [`\sqrt{}`], but don't distribute the part without.
4. Cancel common factor.  
5. Try to plug in point of interest again.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

---

In this problem, the denominator has the [`\sqrt{}`], so the form of the conjugate is determined by the denominator.  

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
Advice for forming the conjugate: 

* If a function looks like [`` \frac{f}{\sqrt{a} + b}``], then the conjugate is [`` \frac{\sqrt{a} - b}{\sqrt{a} - b} = 1 ``].  
* If a function looks like [`` \frac{f}{\sqrt{a} - b}``], then the conjugate is [`` \frac{\sqrt{a} + b}{\sqrt{a} + b} = 1 ``].  

Always flip the sign, and always multiply the function by [`1`].
[@ closeDiv() @]*

One more piece of advice: [`\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{a} = a`].  Use this when distributing.  (In this problem don't distribute the numerator, the [`\sqrt{}`] is in the denominator.)
