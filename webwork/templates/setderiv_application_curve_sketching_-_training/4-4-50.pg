[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Calculus is all about relationships between curves.  
* Functions and their slope functions (first derivatives).
* Functions and their concavity functions (second derivatives)

The point is, if you know some stuff determined by [`f'`] and [`f''`], together with asymptotic behaviour, you pretty much know the function.   

In this series of problems we give you a function and ask you to compute a bunch of properties of the functions.  From these properties, you should be able to sketch a reasonable graph.

Consider the function $PAR

\( f(x) = x^4 - $a x^3 \)

\{ closeDiv() \}

$PAR
🎯 List all the critical points of \(f(x)\). 
(If there are no critical points, enter $BBOLD NONE${EBOLD}.)
$BR
\(x=\) \{ans_rule(50)\}

$PAR
🎯  Use interval notation to indicate where \(f(x)\) is increasing.
$BR
Increasing: \{ans_rule(50)\}
$PAR

🎯  Where is \(f(x)\) decreasing?
$BR
Decreasing: \{ans_rule(50)\}  
$PAR

🎯  List the \(x\) values that correspond to the local maxima of
\(f(x)\). (If there are no local maxima, enter $BBOLD none${EBOLD}.)
$BR
\(x\) values of local maximums \(=\) \{ans_rule(30)\}
$PAR


🎯 Compute the \(x\) values that correspond to the local minima of
\(f(x)\). (If there are no local minima, enter $BBOLD none${EBOLD}.)
$BR
\(x\) values of local minimums \(=\) \{ans_rule(30)\}
$PAR

 🎯 On what intervals is \( f(x) \) is concave up?
$BR
Concave up: \{ans_rule(50)\}

$PAR
🎯  Where \( f(x) \) is concave down?
$BR
Concave down: \{ans_rule(50)\}
$PAR

🎯 List the \(x\) values of all the inflection points of
\(f\). (If there are no inflection points, enter $BBOLD none${EBOLD}.)
$BR
\(x\) values of inflection points \(=\) \{ans_rule(30)\}
$PAR


🏁 Lastly, use the above information to sketch the function, without looking at a computer-generated graph.
