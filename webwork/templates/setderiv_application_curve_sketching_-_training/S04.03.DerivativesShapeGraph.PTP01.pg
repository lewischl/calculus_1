BEGIN_PGML

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Calculus is all about relationships between curves.  
* Functions and their slope functions (first derivatives).
* Functions and their concavity functions (second derivatives)

The point is, if you know some stuff determined by [`f'`] and [`f''`], together with asymptotic behaviour, you pretty much know the function.   

In this series of problems we give you a function and ask you to compute a bunch of properties of the functions.

Instructions:

- If you are asked to find [`x`]- or
[`y`]-values, enter either a number, a list of numbers separated by
commas, or *None* if there aren't any solutions. 

- Use for the interval parts enter [@ $MYEMPTYSET @]* if the interval is empty.

🎯 Find the critical numbers of \(f\), where it is increasing and
decreasing, and its local extrema.
$BR
Critical numbers \( x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\} 
$BR
Increasing on the interval(s) \( x \in \) \{ans_rule(40)\} 
$BR
Decreasing on the interval(s) \( x \in \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
Local maxima \(x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
Local minima \(x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
$BR


🎯 Find where \(f\) is concave up, concave down, and has inflection points.
$BR
Concave up on the interval(s) \( x \in \) \{ans_rule(40)\} 
$BR
Concave down on the interval(s) \( x \in \) \{ans_rule(40)\}  <---- Be careful!  If \(f''=0\), then \(f\) is neither concave down nor up.
$BR
Inflection points at \(x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
$BR


🎯 Find any horizontal and vertical asymptotes of \(f\).
$BR
Horizontal asymptotes at \(y = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
Vertical asymptotes at \(x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
$BR

🎯 🏁 Sketch a graph of the function \( f \) without having a graphing
calculator do it for you.  $BR
1. Mark the \(y\)-intercept and the \(x\)-intercepts, if they are known.   $BR
2. Draw dashed lines for horizontal and vertical asymptotes.  $BR
3. Plot the points where \( f \) has local maxima, local minima, and inflection points.  $BR
4. Use what you know from parts (a) and (b) to sketch the remaining parts of the graph of \( f
\).

On the topic of asymptotes...  $PAR
• Horizontal asymptotes correspond to finite limits at infinity.  See Example 7, page 259 in your book. $BR
• Vertical asympotes come from infinite discontinuities, and where we're trying to divide by 0.  See Example 6, page 258, for an example where the function has a vertical asymptote.
