[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This problem is about the properties of the definite integral:

* Flipping bounds of integration
[@ closeDiv() @]*


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*Flip bounds of integration by paying the minus price*

[```
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx  = - \int_b^a f(x) \, dx
```]

‚ÑπÔ∏è This works regardless of whether [`a < b`].
[@ closeDiv() @]*

üß† I think of this as "reversing the direction of time", if we push the minus sign inside the integral:

[```
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx  = \int_b^a -f(x) \, dx
```]
