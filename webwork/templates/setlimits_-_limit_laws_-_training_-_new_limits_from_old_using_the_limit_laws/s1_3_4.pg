[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This sequence of problems teaches methods for finding limits when we're given a formula
[@ closeDiv() @]*



[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*

If we want to know a limit of a function, we should 
1. find out the limits of its pieces
2. combine using the limit laws, if possible

ðŸ§  I hope you're wondering, "what if I can't use the limit laws because I get [`0/0`]???
