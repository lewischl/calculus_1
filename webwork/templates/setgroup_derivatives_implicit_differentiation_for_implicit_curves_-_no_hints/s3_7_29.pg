BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR 
Differentiting the equation implicitly  with respect to \(x\), we get  
\[ 3x^2 + 3 y^2 y' =0\]
Solving for y' gives
\[ y' = - \frac{x^2}{y^2} \] 
To find \( y''\) we differentiate this expression for \(y'\) using the quotient rule and
remembering that \(y\) is a function of \(x\):
\[ y'' =-  \frac{y^2 \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) -   x^2 \frac{d}{dx}(y^2)}{(y^2)^2} 
= - \frac{ y^2 \cdot 2x - x^2 ( 2 y y')}{y^4} \]
If we now substitute \( y' = - \frac{x^2}{y^2} \) into this expression, we get
\[ y''= - \frac{  2 x y^2 - 2 x^2  y \left( - \frac{x^2}{y^2} \right)}{y^4} 
= -\frac{2x y^3 + 2 x^4}{y^5} = - \frac{2x ( y^3 + x^3)}{y^5} \]
But the values of \(x\) and \(y \) must satisfy the original equation 
\(x^3 + y^3 = $a \). So this expression simplifies to 
\[ y'' = -\frac{$a2 x}{y^5} \]
Substituting \(x = $a_numb\) and  \( y = 1 \) gives
\[ y''($a_numb) = $A \]
