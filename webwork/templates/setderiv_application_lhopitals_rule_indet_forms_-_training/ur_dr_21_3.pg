BEGIN_PGML

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Sometimes a limit requires multiple applications of L'Hopital's rule to peel away the mask behind which lies the true value of the limit.  This problem offers training.

[@ closeDiv() @]*

In this problem, we have a limit of a rational function which is *twice* an indeterminate form.  We'll just keep applying L'Hopital's rule until we get a non-indeterminate form.  It ain't so bad.


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
If you get an indeterminate form [`0/0`] or [`\infty/\infty`] after applying L'Hopital's rule, try again, until you finally reveal the true value (which could be literally anything, including DNE)
[@ closeDiv() @]*

I'll again guide you through the steps.

---

Here's the problem statement:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) @]*
Evaluate the limit using L'Hospital's rule 

[``\lim_{x\to [$a]} \frac{[$num]}{[$den]} ``]
[@ closeDiv() @]*

END_PGML



BEGIN_TEXT
First, we verify the limit is an indeterminate form.  ðŸŽ¯ Evaluate at \(x = $a\).$PAR

\{ openDiv({"class" => "nothing"}) \}
\( \displaystyle 
\lim_{x \to $a} \frac{$f}{$g} = 
\)
\{ ans_fraction() \}

\{ closeDiv() \}which is a \{ $pops->menu() \} indeterminate form.  $PAR

BEGIN_TEXT

Having verified that we have one of the forms that allow us to apply L'Hopital's rule, we consider the limit of the rates at which \($f\) and \($g\) go to their limits.  I'll set up the sequence of computations, you ðŸŽ¯ fill in the computations.
$PAR
1. Compute \(f'\) and \(g'\) $BR
2. Evaluate at the point of interest
$PAR

\{ openDiv({"class" => "nothing"}) \}
\( \displaystyle 
\lim_{x \to $a} \frac{$f}{$g} = 
\)
\{ ans_fraction() \} \( = \) \{ ans_fraction() \}
\{ closeDiv() \}

$PAR $BR
END_TEXT

ANS($g->D->cmp);

ANS(Compute($f->D->eval(x=>$a))->cmp);
ANS(Compute($g->D->eval(x=>$a))->cmp);

BEGIN_TEXT
We found another indeterminate form!!! Let's apply L'Hopital's rule again.  ðŸŽ¯ Fill in the computations.
$PAR
1. Compute \((f')'\) and \((g')'\) $BR
2. Evaluate at the point of interest

$PAR

\{ openDiv({"class" => "nothing"}) \}
\( \displaystyle 
\lim_{x \to $a} \frac{f'}{g'} = 
\)
\{ ans_fraction() \} \( = \) \{ ans_fraction() \}

END_TEXT

ANS($gp->D->cmp);
ANS(($fp->D->eval(x=>$a))->cmp);

BEGIN_TEXT



Having finally found a not-indeterminate-form after two applications of the rule, we know the value of the original limit.  ðŸŽ¯ Complete the problem by entering the value of the limit:

\( \displaystyle 
\lim_{x \to $a} \frac{$f}{$g} =
