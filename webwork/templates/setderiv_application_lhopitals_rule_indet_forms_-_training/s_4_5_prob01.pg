[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This problem offers training on using a technique called "L'Hopital's Rule" for computing some indeterminate form limits.  

This technique has applications:
* in Calculus 2 when computing improper integrals
* in Computer Science when analyzing asymptotic runtimes of algorithms
* in biology, when reasoning about long term behaviour of dynamical systems

[@ closeDiv() @]*

I'd like to first remind you of "indeterminate forms".  They came up in our quest to be able to compute the limits for any function at any point of interest.


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*Indeterminate forms*

A limit [``\lim_{x \to a} f(x)``] is an __indeterminate form__ if when we try to plug in or simply evaluate a limit we get one of the following forms:

* [`\frac{\infty}{\infty}`]
* [`\frac{0}{0}`]
* [`\infty - \infty`]
* [`0^0`]
* [`1^\infty`]
[@ closeDiv() @]*

ℹ️ An indeterminate form reveals nothing about the limit.  Just that the function is discontinuous at [`x=a`].  It's a sign for "do more analysis".

Two of these forms have a nice technique we call "L'Hopital's rule", which is based on comparing __how fast__ the functions in a ratio go towards their limits.

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*L'Hopital's rule for [`\frac{0}{0}`] and [`\frac{\infty}{\infty}`]*

Consider a limit [``\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}``].

The limit *must* satisfy a few conditions in order to apply the rule:
1. The limit must be indeterminate form of one of these two: [`\frac{0}{0}`] or [`\frac{\infty}{\infty}`]*
2. The functions in the numerator and denominator must be differentiable at [`x=a`].

*IF* [``\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L``] (we get a non-indeterminate form), 

*THEN* [``\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} ``]

[@ closeDiv() @]*

The sequence to use the rule goes something like this:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) @]*
1. Try plugging in [`x=a`].  
2. If get [`0/0`] or [`\infty/\infty`], keep going.  Otherwise, reformulate or do something else.
3. Try computing [``\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'}{g'}``], comparing the rate at which [`f`] and [`g`] go to their limits.
4. If you get a determinate value ([`0`], another number, [`\infty`], or DNE you're done.
5. If you get [`0/0`] or [`\infty/\infty`] again, goto 3 and try with the next order of derivative.
[@ closeDiv() @]*


I'll guide you through this application to help you get started.  I hope you enjoy this guided training problem.

I'll start with stating the limit problem: $PAR
\{ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) \}
Use l'Hospital's Rule to evaluate the limit. $PAR
\( \displaystyle 
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{$f}{$g}
\)

\{ closeDiv() \}

$PAR $BR

First, we need to try to 🎯 evaluate at the point of interest.  $BR

\{ openDiv({"class" => "nothing"}) \}
\( \displaystyle 
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{$f}{$g} =

\{ ans_fraction() \}

\{ closeDiv() \}which is a \{ $pops->menu() \} intederminate form.

$PAR $BR

Having verified that we have one of the forms that allow us to apply L'Hopital's rule, we consider the limit of the rates at which \($f\) and \($g\) go to their limits.  I'll set up the sequence of computations, you 🎯 fill in the computations.
$PAR
1. Compute \(f'\) and \(g'\) $BR
2. Evaluate at the point of interest
$PAR
