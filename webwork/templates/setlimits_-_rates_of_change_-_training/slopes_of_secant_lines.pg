Secant lines are lines that are defined by two points on the graph of a function.  This problem teaches you to compute slopes of secant lines.

\{ openDiv({ "class" => "trainingProblemStatement" }) \}
In this problem, you'll be computing slopes of \{ htmlLink("https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SecantLine.html", "secant lines") \}, on the graph of the function

\[
y = \frac{$a1}{x}
\]
\{ closeDiv() \}

The function is a \{ htmlLink( "https://undergroundmathematics.org/glossary/hyperbola", "hyperbola" ) \} with a vertical asymptote at \(x = 0\), because the denominator is \(0\) at that point (and there's no matching zero in the numerator -- the issue is complicated!).

BEGIN_PGML

---

When we talk about [@ htmlLink("https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SecantLine.html", "secant lines") @]*, we often fix one of the two points that define the line.  I like to call that point the *fixed point*, *base point*, or *point of interest*.  A second point moves, but one of them stays the same.  (Doing this provides a bridge to talking about the method for defining tangent lines).

END_PGML

BEGIN_TEXT

Take the point \(P\) to be the fixed point for this problem.  It must line on the graph, so giving you the \(x\)-value also gives you the \(y\)-value.  Just evaluate the function.

$PAR

Let \(x_0 = $x0\).  Then the fixed point has coordinates \(P = ($x0, \) \{ans_rule(10)\} \()\)

$PAR
$HR
$PAR

Let the $BBOLD moving point $EBOLD  be called \( Q \), and we'll denote its coordinates as \( (x_1, y(x_1) ) .\)  

\{ openDiv( {"class" => "inProblemHint"} ) \}
Note that \(y(x_1)\) in the second coordinate of \(Q\) means function evaluation, not multiplication by \(x_1\).  We use parentheses to denote function evaluation sometimes, and multiplication at other times.  I wish they had different symbols, but alas, they don't right now.

\{ openDiv( {"class" => "promptOrInstruction"} ) \}
Find the slope of the secant line \( PQ \) for the following values of \( x_1 \). Remember that slope of a line is always defined using "rise over run".  Compute the difference of the \(y\)-coordinates, and divide by the difference of the \(x\)-coordinates.
\{ closeDiv() \}

$PAR

These first two have the moving point \(Q\) to the right of \(P\).  This means the value of \(\Delta x\) is positive. $PAR

If \( x_1= $x1 \), the slope of the secant line through \( P\) and \(Q \) is: \{ans_rule(25) \} $BR

If \( x_1= $x01 \), the slope of the secant line is: \{ans_rule(25)\} $BR
$PAR

These next two have the moving point \(Q\) to the left of \(P\).  This means the value of \(\Delta x\) is negative.  Negative values of \(\Delta x\) mean the second point is to the left.$PAR


If \( x_1= $x9 \), the slope of the secant line is: \{ans_rule(25)\} $BR
