Assume that you are driving a car at $v miles per hour.

$PAR$HR$PAR 

A.$PAR

If the car decelerates at a constant rate of $g feet per second squared, how many seconds will it take for the car to stop?$BR
It will take \{ans_rule( 25)\} seconds to stop.$BR


$PAR$HR$PAR 

B. $PAR

In that time, how many total feet will the car travel?$BR
The car will travel \{ans_rule( 25) \} feet.

$PAR$HR$PAR

C. $PAR

Assuming that it takes you 1 second to react to an emergency
before you start braking, at the same initial speed, and the same
constant deceleration, what is the total distance the car will travel before coming to a stop?$BR
Including travel during the reaction time, the car will travel \{ans_rule( 25) \} feet before stopping.

BEGIN_HINT
Note the units in this problem.  Recall that there are 5280 feet in a mile, and 3600 seconds in an hour.

$PAR

Beware premature rounding!
END_HINT

$vfs = $v*5280/3600;
$tstop = $vfs/$g;
ANS(num_cmp($tstop));
ANS(num_cmp($vfs/2*$tstop));
ANS(num_cmp($vfs/2*$tstop+$vfs));
