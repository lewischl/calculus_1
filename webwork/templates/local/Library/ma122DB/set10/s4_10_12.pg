#
#Recall that for a term of the form \( Ax^n \) the antiderivative is
#just the term whose derivative is \( Ax^n \).  That is, 
#\(\frac{A}{n+1}x^{n+1} + C \) where \( C \) is an unknown constant.  Also,
#recall that the antiderivative of the \( \sec^2 \) function is the \( \tan \)
# function.  Applying these rules term-by-term to our function, we get:
#$BR$BR
#
#\[F(t) = $a1\tan{t} - \frac{$b1}{\{$n1+1\}}t^{\{$n1+1\}} + C\]
#\[\quad = $a1\tan{t} - \{$b1/($n1+1)\}t^{\{$n1+1\}} + C \]
#
#$BR$BR
#
#Where \( C \) is an artibrary constant.  We are further told that \( F(0) =
#0 \) so plugging this into the above general antiderivative, we get:
#$BR$BR
#
#\[ F(0) = $a1\tan{0} - \{$b1/($n1+1)\}(0)^{\{$n1+1\}} + C = 0 \]
# 
#$BR$BR
#
#So that the specific antiderivative is:
#\[
#  F(t) = $a1\tan{t} - \{$b1/($n1+1)\}t^{\{$n1+1\}}
#\]
