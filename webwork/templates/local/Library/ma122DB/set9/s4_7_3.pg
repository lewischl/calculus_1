BEGIN_HINT
This is an abstract applied optimization problem, like problems 5 and 6 in the Rogaski 4th edition textbook, page 269.  The objective function is the sum, and the constraint is the product.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR 
Let \(x\) and \(y\) be the two numbers. Since \(x y= $b \), we have 
\( y = \frac{$b}{x} \) and we want to minimize
\[ f(x) = x +  \frac{$b}{x} \quad \text{where} \; x >0 \]
\[ f'(x) = 1- \frac{$b}{x^2} = \frac{x^2 - $b}{x^2} \]
The positive critical number is \( x = \sqrt{$b} = $a \).
$BR
Since \(f'(x) <0\) for \( 0 < x < $a \) and \( f'(x) >0 \) for \( x > $a \), there
is an absolute minimum at \(x = $a\).
$BR
Thus the numbers are   \($a\) and \($a\).
