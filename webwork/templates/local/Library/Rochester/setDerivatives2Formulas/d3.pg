HINT: $BR

Use the product rule and the power rule by the books.  Write it out, and evaluate it at \(-1\).  The derivative of the product is the derivative of the first times the second, plus the first times the derivative of the second.

$BR$BR

Even though we don't have a formula for \(g\), we do have its value at the point of interest, as well as the value of \(g^\prime\) there, too.
