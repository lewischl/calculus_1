[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
We're building towards being able to "classify" a critical point as a local min / local max / neither, just by looking at the sign of the first derivative on either side.

This problem aims to demonstrate that the critical numbers of a function separate its domain into intervals on which the function is strictly increasing or decreasing.
[@ closeDiv() @]*


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
A function can only change from increasing to decreasing, or decreasing to increasing, at critical numbers / critical points.

BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the function \( f(x) = x^{2}e^{$a x} \).$PAR


For this function there are three intervals separated by critical numbers on which \(f\) is strictly increasing / decreasing.  Let's call the critical numbers \(A\) and \(B\).

 \[\textnormal{domain}(f) =  (-\infty, A] \cup [A,B] \cup [B,\infty) \]
 
$PAR

Find the values of the critical numbers, from lowest to greatest: $BR
\( A = \) \{ans_rule(20) \}  $BR 
\( B=  \) \{ans_rule(20) \}

For each of the following intervals, determine whether [` f(x) `]
is increasing or decreasing.


For [` x \in (-\infty, A) `], [`f`] is [_]{$ans3}  

For [` x \in (A,B) `], [`f`] is [_]{$ans4}  

For [` x \in (B,\infty) `], [`f`] is [_]{$ans5}  

At [`x = A`], [`f`] is [_]{$ans6}  

At [`x = B`], [`f`] is [_]{$ans7}  

---

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "inProblemHint" }) @]*
To find the critical numbers, you'll need to solve [`f' = 0`].  Factor out the exponential after differentiating.  Remember, no exponential is *ever* equal to [`0`], so you can freely divide by it.
