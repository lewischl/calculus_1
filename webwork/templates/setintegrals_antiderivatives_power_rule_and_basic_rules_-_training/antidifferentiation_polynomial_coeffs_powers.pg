[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This problem is about using the power rule on a polynomial -- a function with integer powers of [`x`].
[@ closeDiv() @]*

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*The power rule for integration*

[```
\int x^n \, dx =  \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1}
```]

‚ö†Ô∏è This is not true if [`n=-1`], because then we‚Äôd have to divide by [`0`]. 
[@ closeDiv() @]*

Combined with the sum/difference rule, we can integrate each term in a polynomial separately.
