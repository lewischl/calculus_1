[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This problem is an infinite-attempts opportunity to integrate a polynomial.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

Polynomials are the easiest class of functions to integrate.  Integer powers keep the "power rule for integration" simple.


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*The power rule for integration*

[```
\int x^n \, dx =  \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1}
```]

⚠️ This is not true if [`n = -1`], because then we'd have to divide by [`0`].

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$SOL $BR

Recall that for a term of the form \( Ax^n \) the antiderivative is
just the term whose derivative is \( Ax^n \).  That is, 
\(\frac{A}{n+1}x^{n+1} + C \) where \( C \) is an unknown constant.
The antiderivative of a constant \( A \) is given by \( Ax \).  So, 
to find the antiderivative of this expression, we apply
these rules term-by-term to get:
$PAR
\[
   F(x) = \frac{$a1}{\{$n1+1\}}x^{\{$n1+1\}} + 
          \frac{$b1}{\{$m1+1\}}x^{\{$m1+1\}} - 
          \frac{$c1}{\{$p1+1\}}x^{\{$p1+1\}} - 
          {$d1}x + C
\]
$PAR
Where \( C \) is an artibrary constant.  In your solution, you may replace
C with any number you wish, or leave it off entirely (which is when \( C 
= 0 \)).
