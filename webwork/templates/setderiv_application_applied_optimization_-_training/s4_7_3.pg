[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
In the realm of "applied optimization", this is a simple problem.  I'm using it early in this training set deliberately because it's simple, to help see *some* of the pattern before we see the bigger picture.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

One of the things that makes these problems difficult is that you're not told the variable names, the function names, etc.  You have to make up the notation!  I have advice:


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
When choosing names for optimization problems:
* always name the objective function (the quantity you're optimizing) [`\Omega`].  It helps see the pattern, and when you see [`\Omega`] you'll think "I should optimize that...".
* Choose "obvious" variable names if possible.  
    * Oldies but goodies like [`x`], [`y`], [`z`] are my favorite
    * Volume should be [`V`], area should be [`A`], distance should be [`D`]...
    * [`a`] and [`b`] are pretty ok.  
* Avoid choices that lead to mistakes:
    * [`l`] (a lowercase L) is *terrible*.  It looks like a one.  Use [`\ell`] instead.  [@ htmlLink("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNpIOlDhigw", "Put a loop on it")@]*.
    * [`o`] and [`O`] are utter 🗑️ for variable names.  They look too much like [`0`].  Don't do it.  
[@ closeDiv() @]*


Ok, so here's what you're gonna do on this problem:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) @]*
Steps for *this* problem

1. Decide on variable names.  Choose [`x`] and [`y`] please.
2. Write a formula for [`\Omega(x,y)`], the quantity to optimize.  In this case, it's the sum we're minimizing.
3. Eliminate [`y`] using the given constraint to obtain [`\Omega(x)`].  Solve "the product is [`[$b]`] for [`y`] and substitute into [`\Omega`].
5. Note that [`x`] must be positive, and so must [`y`].
6. Optimize the objective function.  
7. Conclude.  In this case, we want the numbers that minimize the sum, *not* the actual sum of the numbers.

BEGIN_TEXT

Find two positive numbers whose product is \($b\) and whose sum is a
minimum.
$BR$BR
The two positive numbers are:  \{ans_rule(10)\} and \{ans_rule(10)\}  (in either order)

END_TEXT



BEGIN_HINT
This is an abstract applied optimization problem, like problems 5 and 6 in the Rogaski 4th edition textbook, page 269.  The objective function is the sum, and the constraint is the product.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR 
Let \(x\) and \(y\) be the two numbers. Since \(x y= $b \), we have 
\( y = \frac{$b}{x} \) and we want to minimize
\[ f(x) = x +  \frac{$b}{x} \quad \text{where} \; x >0 \]
\[ f'(x) = 1- \frac{$b}{x^2} = \frac{x^2 - $b}{x^2} \]
The positive critical number is \( x = \sqrt{$b} = $a \).
$BR
Since \(f'(x) <0\) for \( 0 < x < $a \) and \( f'(x) >0 \) for \( x > $a \), there
is an absolute minimum at \(x = $a\).
$BR
Thus the numbers are   \($a\) and \($a\).
