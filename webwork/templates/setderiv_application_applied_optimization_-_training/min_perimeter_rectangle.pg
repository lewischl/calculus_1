[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This is an "applied optimization" problem, focusing on area.
* Optimization, because we're computing mins and maxes
* Applied, because the objective functions -- the functions we optimize -- have a real meaning.

This problem offers advice and guidance.  

[@ closeDiv() @]*



The precise steps varies by problem, as there is a very wide variety.  

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
General steps for applied optimization

1. Draw a picture. 🖼️
2. Decide on variable names. Annotate and label things.  
3. Write a formula for the objective function.  Always call the objective function [`\Omega`].  
4. Eliminate extra variables, if necessary, to obtain a single-variable objective function [`\Omega`].
5. Identify an interval of validity, if necessary
6. Optimize the objective function
7. Conclude.

Specified to this problem, the steps might be:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) @]*
Steps for *this* problem

1. Draw rectangle.
2. Name the sides [`x`] and [`y`] 
3. Write a formula for the [`\Omega(x,y)`] modeling the perimeter.
4. Eliminate [`y`] using the area constraint to obtain [`\Omega(x)`].  Solve [`A`] for [`y`] and substitute into [`\Omega`].
5. Note that [`x`] is a length of fence and cannot be negative.
6. Optimize the objective function over [`[0, \infty)`] to find [`\Omega_\textnormal{min}`]
7. Conclude.

[@ closeDiv() @]*


---

Find the dimensions and perimeter of the rectangle with area [`[$as]`] square inches
that has minimum perimeter.  

Dimensions [`x \times y`]: [_]{List($a, $a)}  

Minimum perimeter: [_]{Real($perimeter)} inches

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "inProblemHint" }) @]*
Enter your result for the dimensions as a comma separated list of two numbers
[@ closeDiv() @]*
