[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Training on thinking about rates of change, where the independent variable is NOT time, but instead a property of a geometric object.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

Geometric objects are determined or constituted by their properties:
* area of a square, by side length
* area of a circle, by radius
* area of a triangle, by base and height

If area changes, the other properties have to change, and vice versa.  In this content, we're thinking about how things like area change, as a function of the other properties.

The fundamental principle we're using:
[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
If two things are always equal, then their derivatives must also be equal
[@ closeDiv() @]*

Check out this interactive Desmos graph of a circle together with a graph of area as a function of radius:

[@ $desmos_graph @]*

Use the slider for the radius [`r`] to change the radius (Calculus is all about change!), and observe how the area [`A`] responds. 

The equation for a circle:  [`A = \pi r^2`].  Differentiate with respect to radius, and find that 

[`\frac{dA}{dr} = `] [_]{Formula("2 pi r")}


Compute the rate of area increase with respect to radius, at various radii:
* When [`r = 0.1`] the area changes as [`\frac{dA}{dr}\big|_{r =0.1} = `] [_]{Real(2*pi*0.1)}
* When [`r = 0.5`] the area changes as [`\frac{dA}{dr}\big|_{r=.5} = `] [_]{Real(2*pi*0.5)} 
* When [`r = 1`] the area changes as [`\frac{dA}{dr}\big|_{r=1} = `] [_]{Real(2*pi*1)} 
* When [`r = 1.5`] the area changes as [`\frac{dA}{dr}\big|_{r=1.5} = `] [_]{Real(2*pi*1.5)}

We can conclude that [_]{$pops} as a function of radius.

*Coda*

In the section called "Related rates", we'll think about letting the radius change __as a function of time__, and see how area responds.  

ðŸ§  If two things are equal, their rates of change must also be equal.
