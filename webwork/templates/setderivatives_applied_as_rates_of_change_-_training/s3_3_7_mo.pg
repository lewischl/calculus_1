[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Derivatives are the tool we use to answer the question "how fast".  This problem offers training on interpretation of the first derivative of position as velocity.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

Motion of particles, celestial bodies, object moving on lines, are a common subject of study in Calculus 1.  

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
The standard name for a *position function* is [`s(t)`], or simply [`s`].
[@ closeDiv() @]*

When we differentiate and produce a __slope function__, __first derivative__, or __instantaneous rate of change__, it means something concrete to the original function.  In the context of modeling of motion, the first derivative is the *velocity*.

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
The first derivative of position is velocity.

[```
s'(t) = \frac{ds}{dt} = v(t) = \textnormal{velocity}
```]
[@ closeDiv() @]*

We often, though not always, start our equation of motion at time [`t = 0`], and restrict our domain to [`t\geq 0`].   

---

In this problem, we have the position function, and we want to find the time at which a certain velocity is attained.  So we're not going to evaluate the velocity function, but instead solve an equation using the velocity.

Here's the problem statement:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) @]*
The position function of a particle is given by
[` s(t) = [$f] `], [`t\ge 0`] where [`s`] is measured in meters and [`t`] in seconds. 

When does the particle reach a velocity of [`[$x]`] [`\text{m}/\text{s}`]?
[@ closeDiv() @]*

To start, it would be nice to have a name for this time.  It's a special time, so let's call it [`t^\ast`].
We're asking you to solve an equation, [`v(t^\ast) = [$x]`].  

ðŸŽ¯ Determine [`v(t)`] by differentiating.  Then set [`v(t^\ast) = [$x]`], and solve for [`t^\ast`].  If you find a negative time, disregard it due to the domain restriction.
