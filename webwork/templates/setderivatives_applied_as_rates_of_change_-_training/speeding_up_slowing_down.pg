Here's a summary of the classification for speeding up and slowing down:
[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
Speeding up (or speed increasing) is same as:
* [`v(t)`] positive and [`v'(t)`] positive
* [`v(t)`] negative and [`v'(t)`] negative

Slowing down (or speed decreasing) is same as:
* [`v(t)`] positive and [`v'(t)`] negative
* [`v(t)`] negative and [`v'(t)`] positive
[@ closeDiv() @]*

Speeding up is velocity moving away from 0.  Slowing down is velocity moving towards 0.  


Let [` s(t) = 2 t^3 - [$d1]t^2 + [$e1]t `] for [` t \ge 0 `].

What is the velocity? [_]{$vel_ans}

🎯 Determine the intervals below using interval notation. A plot of [`v(t) = s'(t)`] may be helpful.
* When is [`v(t)`] positive and [`v'(t)`] positive (i.e., when is [`v`] positive and increasing)? [_]{$v_pos_increasing}
* When is [`v(t)`] positive and [`v'(t)`] negative (i.e., when is [`v`] positive and decreasing)? [_]{$v_pos_decreasing}

* When is [`v(t)`] negative and [`v'(t)`] positive (i.e., when is [`v`] negative and  increasing) on [_]{$v_neg_increasing}
* When is [`v(t)`] negative and [`v'(t)`] negative (i.e., when is [`v`] negative and decreasing) on [_]{$v_neg_decreasing}

ℹ️ Speeding up, [`v`] and [`v'`] have same sign.  Slowing down, [`v`] and [`v'`] have opposive sign.
