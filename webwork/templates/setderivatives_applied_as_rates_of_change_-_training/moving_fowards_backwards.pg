[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Training on modeling motion along a line:
* moving forward / backward
[@ closeDiv() @]*


The first derivative answers the super-important question "how fast?".  From this arises a question:
* Is the object moving forward or backward?

Here's a scenario to consider:
END_PGML

BEGIN_TEXT
\{ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) \}
A particle moves along a straight line and its position at time \(t\)
is given by \[ s(t)= 2t^3 - $d1 t^2 + $e1 t, \quad t \geq 0 \] where \( s \) is measured in feet and
\( t \) in seconds.  
\{ closeDiv() \}

BEGIN_PGML

##### Forward and backward

The velocity (first derivative) includes sign information -- it can be positive or negative.  Remember:
* "increasing [`f`]" is the same is "positive [`f'`]"
* "decreasing [`f`]" is the same is "negative [`f'`]"

What does increasing mean when [`f`] is a position function?  It means that the object is moving forward along the linear path, with respect to a reference position.   Similarly, decreasing position function means that the object is moving backwards along the path.  And if the velocity is zero, the object is, at least momentarily, not moving.

Summarized:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
With [`s(t)`] as position and [`v(t)`] as velocity,
* [`v(t) > 0`], moving forward
* [`v(t) < 0`], moving backward
* [`v(t) = 0`], stationary
[@ closeDiv() @]*

\{ openDiv({ "class" => "inProblemHint" }) \}
Remember, time starts at \(t = 0\) in this problem.  Should t=0 be included or excluded? Is the object moving at time \(t = 0\)? Is the velocity zero at time \(t = 0\)?
