BEGIN_PGML
[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Calculus is the language of change.  This problem describes a scenario of change in plain language.  We ask you to translate it into a graph by matching.
[@ closeDiv() @]*


You place a frozen turkey pot pie in an oven and bake it for 45 minutes. Then you take it out and place it on a table where it cools for an hour.    

* We're measuring the temperature in the center of the pie.
* The horizontal axis is time, starting at the time you put it in the oven. 
* The vertical axis is temperature.  

ðŸŽ¯ Use the radio button to select the graph that qualitatively matches the scenario.
