BEGIN_PGML

Implicit differentiation works for any independent variable:
* if the variable of differentation is the variable being differentiated, we get [`1`].
* If there's a variable mismatch, we have to "chain out" a derivative

For example

[`` \begin{aligned} \frac{d}{dx} x^2 &= 2x \end{aligned} ``]

because the variables match, but


[``\begin{aligned}  \frac{d}{dt} x^2 &= 2x  \frac{dx}{dt}   \\  \frac{d}{dt} V &= \frac{dV}{dt} \end{aligned} ``]

because the variable of differentiation, [`t`], mismatches with the variables being differentiated, so we "chain out" derivatives.

---

Use implicit differentiation to compute the derivatives.  Use differential notation (like [`dx/dt`]) to express derivatives.

The area of a circle:
[`` \frac{d}{dt} \left( \pi r^2  \right) = ``] [_____]{$ans1}

The volume of a sphere:
[`` \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3  \right) = ``] [_____]{$ans2}

The square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle: [`` \frac{d}{dt} \left( x^2 + y^2  \right) = ``] [_____]{$ans3}

The volume of a cube:
[`` \frac{d}{dt} \left( x^3  \right) = ``] [_____]{$ans4}

The area of a rectangle where both side lengths are changing:
[`` \frac{d}{dt} \left( xy  \right) = ``] [_____]{$ans5}
