[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This problem offers a connection between implicit differentation for slopes on implicit curves, and the broader world of changing quantities.
[@ closeDiv() @]*


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
Implicit differentiation works for any independent variable:
* If the variable of differentation is the variable being differentiated, we get [`1`].
* If there's a variable mismatch, we have to "chain out" a derivative
[@ closeDiv() @]*

For example, because the variable of the function [`x^2`] and the variable of differentiation [`x`] match:

[`` \begin{aligned} \frac{d}{dx} x^2 = 2x \end{aligned} ``].

BUT!  When we differentiate with another variable, we have to use implicit differentiation.  In these two examples, the variable of differentiation [`t`] mismatches with the variables being differentiated, so we must ⛓️ "chain out" derivatives.

* [`` \frac{d}{dt} x^2 = 2x  \frac{dx}{dt} ``]  This describes the time-rate-of-change of the area of a square 🔲.

* [`` \frac{d}{dt} 4x = 4 \frac{dx}{dt} ``]  This describes the time-rate-of-change of the perimeter of a square  🔲.

Here's a video from Professor Shull explaining this with an example (this same video was at the top of the previous "problem"):

Use implicit differentiation to compute the derivatives.  Use differential notation (like [`dx/dt`]) to express derivatives.
