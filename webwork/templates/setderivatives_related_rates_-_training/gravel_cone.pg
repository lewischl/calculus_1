BEGIN_PGML

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This is an example of a problem that has "too many variables" to start.  It teaches the skill of using a constraint or geometric property as a tool to reduce the number of variables in a problem.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
The volume of a cone is [``V_{\rm cone} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^2 h ``]
[@ closeDiv() @]*

END_PGML

$a = random(10,50,10);
$h = random(10,25,1);




BEGIN_PGML

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) @]*
Follow these steps, and try to see the pattern of using a constraint to eliminate a variable:

1. Draw a picture of a growing cone.  Label the radius, height, and volume.  Draw arrows to denote change.
2. Relate the variables for volume, radius, and height.
3. Don't differentiate yet.
4. Draw a picture of a cross-section of the cone, and then a larger one that shares the tip.   ðŸ‘€ See the [@ htmlLink("https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/triangles-similar.html","similar triangles") @]*.
5. Use the similar triangle relationship to eliminate the radius from the equation for volume.
6. Now differentiate
7. Substitute in known quantities.
8. Solve for the desired quantity, the rate at which height increases.

BEGIN_TEXT

\{ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) \}

Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of
$a \( {\rm ft}^3{\rm /min}\). It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular
cone whose height is always three times the radius.

\{ closeDiv() \}

$PAR
How fast is the height of the pile increasing when the pile is $h \( {\rm ft}\) high?
$PAR

END_TEXT



BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
The height is increasing at \{ans_rule(20) \} \( {\rm ft}\)/\( {\rm min}\).

BEGIN_HINT

Prof. Amethyst does also have a video on the subject of a related rates problem involving a cone.  The problem isn't exactly the same, but perhaps you'd find it useful?
