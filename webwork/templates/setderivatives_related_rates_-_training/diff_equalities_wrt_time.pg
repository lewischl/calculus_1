[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This problem pushes you to embrace the general truism that if two quantities are equal, their derivatives must also be equal.

---

Use implicit differentiation to compute the derivatives of each side of each equality.  Use differential notation (like [`dx/dt`]) to express derivatives.  Keep left on left, right on right.

For example,

[`` A = x^2 ``]

is the formula for area of a square with sidelength [`x`].  And if either [`A`] or [`x`] changes, the other must also change.  Thus,

[`` \frac{dA}{dt} = 2x \frac{dx}{dt} ``]

---

###### The area of a circle

[`` A = \pi r^2 ``]

so when we differentiate with respect to time, we get

[_____]{$lhs1} [`=`] [_____]{$rhs1}

---

###### The volume of a sphere:

[`` V =  \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 ``]

so when we differentiate with respect to time, we get

[_____]{$lhs2} [`=`] [_____]{$rhs2}

---

###### The square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle


[`` D =  \left( x^2 + y^2  \right) ``] (D = square of distance)

so when we differentiate with respect to time, we get

[_____]{$lhs3} [`=`] [_____]{$rhs3}

---

###### The volume of a cube:

[`` V = x^3 ``] 

so when we differentiate with respect to time, we get

[_____]{$lhs4} [`=`] [_____]{$rhs4}

---

###### The area of a rectangle where both side lengths are changing:

[`` A =  xy  ``]

so when we differentiate with respect to time, we get

[_____]{$lhs5} [`=`] [_____]{$rhs5}

(Did you remember to use a product rule for the right-hand side? If not, ðŸ¤¦)
