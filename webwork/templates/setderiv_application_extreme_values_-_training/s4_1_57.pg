[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
An opportunity to practice what you know about critical points and the algorithm for finding absolute optima over closed intervals.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

ðŸ§  As you find the critical points, you'll take the derivative and find its roots.  Is this function continuous?  Is it ever not defined?

Consider the function \( f(x) = \displaystyle $f , \quad 0\le x\le 2. \) $BR$BR

It has an absolute maximum value equal to: \{ans_rule(20) \} $BR
which is attained at \(x=\) \{ans_rule(15) \} $BR

This function has an absolute minimum value equal to: \{ans_rule(15) \} $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR 
The quotient rule gives;
\[f'(x) = \frac{$a1 x^2 -1}{($a1 x^2 +1)^2}  \]
Since \(f'(x)\) is defined for all \(x\), the only critical numbers  of \(f\) occur
when \( f'(x) =0 \), that is \( $a1 x^2  -1 =0 \). $BR
This equation is satisfied for \( x = 1/\sqrt{$a1}\) and \(x = -1/\sqrt{$a1}\).
$BR
However, \(x = -1/\sqrt{$a1}\) is not in the interval \( [0, 2]\). Thus the only critical number is \( x = 1/\sqrt{$a1}\). 
The value of \(f\) at this critical number is
\[ f\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{$a1}}\right) = - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{$a1}} \approx $Min\] 
The values of \(f\) at the endpoints of the interval are 
\[ f(0)= 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f(2) =  $V \approx $fx \]
Comparing these values we can see that the  absolute maximum value is \(0 \) and it is attained at \(x = 0 \) while the absolute minimum  value is equal to
\(- \displaystyle \frac{1}{2\sqrt{$a1}} \) and it is attained at \( x = \displaystyle \frac{1}{\sqrt{$a1}}\).
