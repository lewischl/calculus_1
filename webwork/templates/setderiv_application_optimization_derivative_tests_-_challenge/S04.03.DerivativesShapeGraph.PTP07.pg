$PAR
The graphs above are approximate graphs of \( f \) and \( f' \) for the function

$PAR

\( \displaystyle{f(x)=x^2(x-$a)} \).

$PAR

Note that \( f \) is decreasing (and \( f' \) is negative) on the interval \( (0,a) \).  

$PAR $HR $PAR

Compute value of the right endpoint \(a\).
$PAR
\( a=\)\{ans_rule(15)\}.  (Give the largest \(a\) that works.)
