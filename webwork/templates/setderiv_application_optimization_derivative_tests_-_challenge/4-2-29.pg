# Main text

Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_TEXT
Let \( f(x) = $f \).  


$PAR

Find all open intervals on which \( f \) is increasing  and decreasing.  Then determine the \( x\)-coordinates of all local extrema.
$PAR
\{$al->print_q\}
$BR
$BBOLD Notes:$EBOLD
In the first two, your answer should either be a single
interval, such as "(0,1)", a union-symbol separated list of intervals, such as "(-inf, 2) U (3,4)", or the word
${LQ}none$RQ.
$PAR
In the last two, your answer should be a comma-separated list of \( x\) values or the word
${LQ}"none"$RQ (use double quotes to enter string mode).
