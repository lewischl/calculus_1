BEGIN_TEXT
Let \( f(x) = $f \) for \(x>0\).  Find all open intervals on which \( f \) is increasing  and decreasing.  Then determine the \( x\)-coordinates of all local extrema.
$PAR
\{$al->print_q\}
$BR
$BBOLD Notes:$EBOLD $BR
In the first two, your answer should intervals or the word
${LQ}none$RQ.
$PAR
In the last two, your answer should be a comma separated list of \( x\) values or the word
${LQ}none$RQ.
