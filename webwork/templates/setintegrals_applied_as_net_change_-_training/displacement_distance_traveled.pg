[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Training on an application of integration: measuring displacement and distance traveled by integrating velocity or speed.
[@  closeDiv() @]*

The definite integral has several interpretations:
* the signed area under a curve
* the accumulation of change, due to a rate of change


[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
A definite integral
[```
\int_a^b f(t) \, dt
```]
measures accumulated change, where [`f(t)`] is the rate of change.
[@  closeDiv() @]*

That is, the integrand [`f`] is a rate.  We integrate rates.

---

##### Integrating velocity gives net displacement

When the rate of change [`f`] is a *velocity*, it makes sense to instead use the name [`v(t)`] for the integrand.  Note:
* [`v(t)`] may be positive, which means "moving forward"
* [`v(t)`] may be negative, meaning "moving backward"

[``\int_a^b v(t) \, dt``] measures the "net displacement".  A particle may move for a while, and return to where it started, just like I do over the course of a day of work.  

##### Integrating speed gives distance traveled

When the rate [`f`] is a *speed*, the definite integral is guaranteed to be non-negative. 🧠 Think about it.  The speed is never negative!  

[```\text{speed} = \text{abs}(\text{velocity})```]

Since the definite integral measures net area, and a speed is never negative, the integral of speed can't be negative!!!

The integral [`\int_a^b \text{speed}(t) \, dt`] measures the "distance traveled".  This is like the speedometer and odometer in a car 🚗.  A speedometer is never negative; even if you're in reverse, it always reads positive.  And the odometer -- which measures the distance the car has been driven -- is the integral of the speedometer.

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "inProblemHint" }) @]*
ℹ️ One of the things that makes computing distance traveled tricky is that speed is the absolute value of velocity.  
* Absolute values are piecewise functions

To integrate speed:
1. Split the domain of integration where [`v`] changes sign
2. Integrate the regions where [`v > 0`] like normal
3. Integrate the regions where [`v<0`] __with a minus sign__ to make negative velocity into positive speed
4. Add up the regions.  Each region should be positive.

##### Summarizing

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
To measure *net displacement*, integrate velocity

To measure *distance traveled*, integrate speed
[@  closeDiv() @]*

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) @]*
The velocity function for a particle moving along a line is given by [` v(t) = [$ss] t^2 - [$f1] t + [$f2]`], in units   [`\text{ m/s}`]. 

Find the displacement and the total distance traveled by the particle 
during the time interval [`[[$t1],[$t2]]`].
[@  closeDiv() @]*

Net displacement [`=`] [_______]{[$ans1]} [`\text{m}`]

Total distance traveled [`=`] [_______]{[$ans2]} [`\text{m}`]
