Training on an application of integration: measuring accumulation of change
[@  closeDiv() @]*

In Calculus, we integrate rates of change to find accumulated change.  The integrand is a rate of change.

A general process for applications of integration:

1. Identify the rate function, and the duration over which to integrate
2. Integrate
3. Contextualize and conclude

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "promptOrInstruction" }) @]*
Oil is leaking from a large drum, which has been improperly disposed of in the woods, contaminating the soil.  The rate of leakage is [`r(t) = [$rate]`] mL / day.
[@  closeDiv() @]*


A. How many mL of oil leaks in the first [$end] days?  [_____]{num_cmp($ans1)}

B. The financial cleanup cost for this spill is $[$ratecost] dollars per mL, plus a base administrative cost of $[$basecost].  How much does it cost to clean up the spill, if the drum is removed, and oil stops leaking, at [$end] days? [_____]{num_cmp($ans2)}

---

Note that the taxpayers (and the environment) will likely bear the cost of cleanup -- the company will simply "go out of business"...

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
A. Recall that the FTOC says that [`\displaystyle\int_a^b C^\prime(x)~dx=C(b)-C(a)`]

B. Setup costs would represent that cost associated to [`0`] units produced. Said another way,
[`C(0)=[$setupcost]`].
