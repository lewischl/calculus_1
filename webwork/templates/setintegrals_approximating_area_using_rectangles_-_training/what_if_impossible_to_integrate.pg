[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
Motivation and training on why approximating areas with rectangles is necessary.  

In particular, if the integrand is impossible to symbolically integrate we cannot use FTOC1.
[@ closeDiv() @]*


The definite integral is the signed area between [`f`] and the [`x`]-axis.  It's important because
* the signed area represents net change, where [`f`] is the rate of change.

We can compute exact signed area using the incredible Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 1:

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*FTOC1*

[```
\int_a^b f(x)\, dx = F(b)-F(a)
```]

1. Indefinitely integrate to find [`F`].
2. Evaluate [`F`]
3. Subtract
[@ closeDiv() @]*

ðŸ§  But what if step 1 is impossible!?!?  What if we don't know the antiderivative????

---

Consider the integrand corresponding to the probablity density function normal distribution:  (it's ok if this is your first time seeing it)

[```f(x) = [$f]```]

This function has no symbolic antiderivative --- it's a proven mathematical fact.  No alien or human will ever find the formula [`F`] such that [`\frac{dF}{dx} = f`].

But the area under [`f`] is really important.  The area under [`f`] represents the probability of observing outcomes of a normally-distributed process.  And the normal distribution is __everywhere__.  

ðŸ§  How to compute areas under the normal distribution, if no symbolic antiderivative will ever be found??!

---

The answer to the conundrum is approximation.  We satisfy ourselves with a number really close to [`\int_a^b f(x) \, dx`].  Since this is Calculus 1, we'll train you on a relatively simple method: *approximation using rectangles*.  The methods implemented on computers are much more sophisticated.

This is an interactive graph showing approximation of [`` \int_{-2}^2 [$f] \, dx ``], using a variable number of rectangles [`n`], where the heights of the rectangles are determined by their left endpoints.  

[@ $desmos_div @]*

ðŸŽ¯ Use the Desmos graph to answer the questions.

* What is the approximate value of [`` \int_{-2}^2 [$f] \, dx ``] using [`n=1`] rectangle? [_]{Real(0.21596387)}
* What is the approximate value using [`n=5`] rectangles? [_]{Real(0.94312269)}
* Using [`n=20`] rectangles? [_]{Real(0.95378034)}
* Using [`n=50`] rectangles? [_]{Real(0.95438457)}

In principle, how many rectangles must we use to get the value exactly?  [_]{Infinity}

---

The process of breaking a region into smaller approximate areas and adding them up is called "numerical integration".  

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "problemPurpose" }) @]*
This problem demonstrates the need to approximate signed areas for definite integration.  Some integrands cannot be symbolically integrated, and numerical integration is the only technique that works.
