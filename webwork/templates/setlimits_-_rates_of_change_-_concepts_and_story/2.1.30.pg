Refer to the graph above and without making any computations find:

$PAR
The average rate of change over [0,$b] : \{ans_rule (5) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD $PAR

1. \(f(0)=f($b)\), so there is no change between \(x=0\) and \(x=$b\). The average rate of change is zero.
$PAR
2. The tangent line to the graph of \(f(x)\) is horizontal at \(x=$a\); the instantaneous rate of change is zero at this point.
 $PAR
3. The rate of change is positive at all points where the graph is rising, because the slope of the tangent line is positive at these points. This is so for all \(x\) such that \(0<x\leq $a\)
