Consider the function \( f(t) =  $a1 \sec ^2(t) - $b1 t^ { $n1 }  \).
Let \( F(t) \) be the antiderivative of \( f(t) \) with \( F(0) = 0 \).  
Find \( F(t) \).$BR$BR

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR

Recall that for a term of the form \( Ax^n \) the antiderivative is
just the term whose derivative is \( Ax^n \).  That is, 
\(\frac{A}{n+1}x^{n+1} + C \) where \( C \) is an unknown constant.  Also,
recall that the antiderivative of the \( \sec^2 \) function is the \( \tan \)
 function.  Applying these rules term-by-term to our function, we get:
$BR$BR

\[F(t) = $a1\tan{t} - \frac{$b1}{\{$n1+1\}}t^{\{$n1+1\}} + C\]
\[\quad = $a1\tan{t} - \{$b1/($n1+1)\}t^{\{$n1+1\}} + C \]

$BR$BR

Where \( C \) is an artibrary constant.  We are further told that \( F(0) =
0 \) so plugging this into the above general antiderivative, we get:
$BR$BR

\[ F(0) = $a1\tan{0} - \{$b1/($n1+1)\}(0)^{\{$n1+1\}} + C = 0 \]
 
$BR$BR

So that the specific antiderivative is:
\[
  F(t) = $a1\tan{t} - \{$b1/($n1+1)\}t^{\{$n1+1\}}
\]
