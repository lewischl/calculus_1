# reads .def files
# identifies which are VISIBLE tests (formerly gateway-quiz)
# verifies problem files actually exist
# and that groups actually contain that number of problems.

# assumptions: 
# problem set definitions are relatively root, and have suffix `.def`.  
# all .def files present are ones you want to process.  there is no skipping mechanism!
# if a set name start with "group", then it's a collection of problems used elsewhere, and even if it's a "gateway", it's not processed for validation
# 

###########  ‚ö†Ô∏è the "visible" property is NOT in the .def file. it's held somewhere else in non-exportable format.  so...  you have to make sure that no not-visible tests are in here 
# ‚ö†Ô∏è YET, you can't just export all visible sets and not export any invisible sets, because the problem groups are almost certainly invisible. ah, webwork.


test_type_name = "gateway" # i can imagine this will change someday?  they changed the name in the online interface, but it remains gateway under the hood.
