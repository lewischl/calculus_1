# ðŸ”Œ Connection essay



---

## Purpose


This activity is aimed at helping you connect Calculus, the formal language of change, as well as other branches of mathematics (it's a big world ðŸ—º), to something that interests you.  It's intended to be fun, light, exploratory, and done with levity.

The topic you choose could be something you're currently taking a class on, something you've read, watched a show/movie, or listened to a podcast about recently.  

By drawing these connections yourself as the recult of encounter and research, I'm hoping you'll find topics in Calculus I more intesting and applicable.  At the least, you'll find ways that mathematics is used, and hopefully see a little bit more of the possibilities math has to offer.

## Tasks

:dart: Write a 2-page paper about a topic that interests you, exploring the connections between that topic and mathematics.  I'm particularly interested in hearing about connections to Calculus.  


### ðŸ”Ž Suggestions for research techniques

#### ðŸ”Ž Suggestion: Wikipedia

[Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.com) is a pretty mature source of information these days, and a good (but over-used?) starting point.  Start with a search for topics, and use the Bibliography as a launching point to actual sources.  



#### ðŸ”Ž Suggestion: search engine search

Some interesting [google](https://google.com) or [duck duck go](https://duckduckgo.com) searches, probably:

* mathematical bla
* differential equations bla
* mathematical modeling bla
* math bla
* computational bla
* data science bla
* modeling bla


#### ðŸ”Ž Suggestion: google scholar

Lookin' for a hardcore scientific result?  [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com) is amazing.  Type in some search terms, and look for results that are pdf documents.
