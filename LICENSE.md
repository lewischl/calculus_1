# Webwork

I have no idea what the license for the Webwork content is.  

I derived the content from problems from the Open Problem Library, and did my best to track problem provenance.  Many problems are now significantly different from their original versions, and I think pretty much all of them have been modified in at least some way.  I believe the purpose of the OPL is to provide a source of problems from which one may derive in order to teach mathematics, and that is precisely what I have done.  Individual problems in the OPL have no statement of license, and none of the problems herein do, either.

This much is clear, though I am not a lawyer: this content was developed for educational purposes, without the intent of selling or using the content for profit.  No later person may use this content for commercial purpose or attempt to profit from it, including charging students to use a Webwork instance in which these problems are used.

If you do use it, please attribute the source of the content.  And if you derive from it, please try to keep records of provenance and modification.
