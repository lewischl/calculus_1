I refuse to type Webwork with their stupid capitalization scheme, it's too complicated.  I urge Webwork to change its styling to something simple.  I know this request is ludicrous, especially coming from someone who uses an atypical capitalization scheme for their own name -- but all-lower is objectively simpler to type and use than the nonsense Webwork uses.
